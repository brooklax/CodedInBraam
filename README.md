#### Getting Started

##### Requirements
- Git
- A development server to host the app on your development machine. We recommend **live-server** which requires Node.js (download Node.js here: https://nodejs.org/). You can find installation and usage instructions for **live-server** here: https://github.com/tapio/live-server/ .
- A text editor. We recommend Atom (https://atom.io/), Brackets (http://brackets.io/), or Sublime (http://www.sublimetext.com/).

##### Handy Info
- All major stages of the app are numbered from 00 to 04. Type in **git branch -a** to list all the branch names and type in **git checkout branch_name** to enter that branch.
- The **snippets** directory explains how to get your app from a normal Angular app to using the ngMaterial, ngMdIcons and Firebase libraries.

#### To begin
##### Clone the repo
- Clone the repository into a directory on your computer. Familiarise yourself with the file structure.

##### Choose a starting point and work from there
- Check out the 00 branch and build something!

#### If you get stuck
- Refer to the snippets, they will guide you towards building the final app.
- If you are not sure where certain directives are placed to be used correctly why not check the Angular online documentation: https://docs.angularjs.org/api
