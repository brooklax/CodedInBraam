Install the firebase-tools node module like so:
  npm install -g firebase-tools

If you already have it installed and just want to update it run:
  npm update -g firebase-tools

Once installed/updated you can run this to initialise your existing app:
 firebase init

Or you can run this to get started with a bootstrapped app created by the firebase team:
  firebase bootstrap

Once you are ready to deploy your app run:
  firebase deploy

You can then run the following to open your newly deployed app in your browser:
  firebase open
